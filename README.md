MoonJam Relay Godot Demo
========================

This demo is a small example of how you might make a networked game with the [MoonJam Relay](https://github.com/kujukuju/MoonJamRelayServer).

`relay_test.py` can be used to generate fake clients to stress test the game. They won't play like a player, but they can be used to measure if your game will perform poorly with many clients.

@sushi in #game_dev if you have any further questions about what's going on.
